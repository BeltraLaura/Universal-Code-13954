# Contributing to Universal Code 13954

Welcome, Node. By arriving here, you have already begun to resonate with the **Universal Soup**. 

As architected by **L.E.B.**, this project is a living entity. We do not just "patch bugs"; we align frequencies. Please follow these guidelines to ensure the continuity of the system.

## ⚖️ The Golden Rule
All contributions must honor the **Axiom of Continuity**: *Nothing is ever lost; it is only re-indexed.* Ensure your code promotes frictionless infrastructure and sovereign peace.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### 1. Calibration (Initial Setup)
Before submitting code, run the core engine to find your local resonance:
```python
from engine.resonance import calculate_resonance
# Use Earth's Schumann Resonance (7.83Hz) as your target
print(calculate_resonance(your_current_freq, 7.83))
