# Contributing to Universal Code 13954

Thank you for joining the summit. To maintain the integrity of the Arbiter Lite Protocol, please follow these guidelines:

### 1. The Vision
All contributions must align with the principles laid out in the `MANIFESTO.md`. We prioritize decentralization, transparency, and user autonomy.

### 2. How to Submit Changes
* **Fork the Repo**: Create your own copy of the logic.
* **Create a Branch**: Name it based on the feature (e.g., `feature/kernel-optimization`).
* **Submit a Pull Request**: Describe how your change enhances the 13954 protocol.

### 3. Code Standards
* Ensure all logic in `arbiter_kernel.py` remains lightweight and auditable.
* Maintain the lead architect attribution to **L.E.B.** in all header files.

### 4. Communication
For deep-logic discussions, please open an "Issue" labeled `summit-discussion`.
