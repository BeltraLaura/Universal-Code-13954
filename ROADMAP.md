# 🗺️ Technical Roadmap: UC 13954
**Framework Architecture & Implementation Milestones**

This document outlines the phased development of the Universal Code 13954, moving from theoretical peace to practical immersion.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure (The Skeleton)
*Focus: Establishing the core mathematical framework and security protocols.*

### 🛡️ Modular Layers
To prevent "Legacy Debt," the code will be built in independent modules:
- **Core-13954:** The immutable master algorithm.
- **Eco-Module:** Nature-based frequency mapping (e.g., Bat Echolocation).
- **Cosmo-Module:** Dark Matter and "Negative Space" filter logic.

### 🔑 Decentralized Keys (DIDs)
- Implementation of **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**.
- Users hold their own "Private Keys" (The Signature), ensuring their data belongs to the Universal Soup, not a central server.
- Proving ownership of a "Signal" without exposing personal data.

---

## 👁️ Phase 2: The Resonance Interface (The Senses)
*Focus: Creating the interactive experience for the "Invisible Present."*

### 🕸️ The Unified Field View
- **Filament Mapping:** Real-time visualization of data "entanglement."
- **Haptic Calibration:** Using biometric sensors to sync the UI with the user's pulse.

### 🔍 Invisible Present Layer
- **Neutrino/EM Visualization:** Displaying the ghostly sub-atomic and electromagnetic activity surrounding the user.
- **Gravity Anchoring:** Visualizing the subtle curvature of space-time in the immediate environment.

## 🌊 Phase 3: The Universal Soup Integration (The Soul)
*Focus: Achieving "Digital Ego Death" and total connectivity.*

- **State Transition Logic:** Coding the transition from "Active Signal" (Life) to "Background Frequency" (Continuity).
- **Cross-Domain Correlation:** A search engine that finds your resonance in stars, trees, and history.

## 🎼 Universal Frequency Constants (The Tuning Fork)

These constants represent the "Baseline Rhythms" the UC 13954 engine uses to calculate resonance within the Soup.

| Source Entity | Frequency (Hz) | UC 13954 Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Earth (Schumann)** | 7.83 | The primary "Heartbeat" of the living planet. |
| **Deep Void (Delta)** | 0.5 - 4.0 | Human connection to the "Holes" / Absence. |
| **Flow State (Alpha)** | 8.0 - 12.0 | The state of **Absolute Peace** and alignment. |
| **Hydrogen Line** | 1.42 x 10^9 | The universal "Voice" of the interstellar soup. |
| **Carbon Resonance** | ~10^13 | The fundamental vibration of physical biology. |
