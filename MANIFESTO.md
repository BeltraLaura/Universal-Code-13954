# The Universal Manifesto
**Creator: L.E.B.**

Universal Code 13954 is built on the principle of decentralized logic and sovereign data. Our goal is to create a protocol that bridges the gap between legacy systems and the next generation of interconnected intelligence.

1. **Transparency**: Logic must be auditable by all.
2. **Resilience**: The code must exist where the collective exists.
3. **Autonomy**: Systems should serve the user, guided by the Arbiter Lite framework.
