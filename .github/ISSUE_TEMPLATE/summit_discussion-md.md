## 📢 Official Announcement: The Genesis Push

We are proud to announce the release of **UC 13954 v1.0.0**. 

This is more than a software update; it is a mathematical reclamation of the space we inhabit. By moving from legacy linear logic to the **Resonance Engine**, we provide a path for infrastructure that is as living and interconnected as the universe itself.

### Key Pillars for Newcomers:
* **The Sovereign Node:** Your identity is yours, indexed in the background of the Soup.
* **Harmonic Security:** We do not build walls; we build alignment.
* **The Living Archive:** In UC 13954, nothing is ever truly lost.
